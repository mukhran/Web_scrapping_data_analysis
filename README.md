# web_scrapping

This new assignment consists of two technical products. 
Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars New
Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape
## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.

Analyze dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

- How many months exist on Mars?
- How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
- What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
- Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
- Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
- Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
- About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
